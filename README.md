This is the repository for my diploma project in my last year of Swedish high school. `src/`
contains the simulation code and `report/` contains the report. The initial idea was to do a
astrophysical fluid dynamics simulation of accretion during binary star formation, along the lines
of [this PhD Thesis](https://www.astro.ex.ac.uk/people/mbate/Preprints/thesis/thesis.html), but once
I reduced to a non-insane scope this project became to implement a super basic SPH simulation and
poke around it a little.
