Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is a lagrangian, particle-based, method in
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) that is especially suited to simulations where processes on
wildly different spatial scales are relevant. This work implements SPH with self-gravity among the
particles. The simulation models adiabatic, compressible flow, but viscosity is ignored.

Four simulations of a protostellar gas cloud are performed on a personal computer. The results show
that the simulation conserves momentum and that the gas experiences adiabatic heating. However,
energy is not strictly conserved - in particular, the transformation between thermal and kinetic
energy is not conservative. Additionally, kinetic energy is not dissipated which prevents accretion.
It should be possible to solve these problems by implementing viscosity.
