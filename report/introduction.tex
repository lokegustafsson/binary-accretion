\section{Background}
Simulating physical phenomena allows us to leverage immense advancement in the field of computing
for developing and testing physical models. Fluid dynamics is especially suited for simulation,
among other things due to its chaotical nature. Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics is a framework in
computational fluid dynamics that allows simulation of wildly different spatial scales in the same
simulation.

\section{Aim}
Simulating and verifying phenomena such as the flattening of rotating matter into discs, in addition
to investigating what physical processes are relevant to a simulation. In particular, the
limitations of a bare-bones SPH implementation are considered.

\section{Limitations}
The simulation is computed on a personal computer with a run time measured in minutes - the
properties of the computational model is prioritized over the numerical and physical accuracy of the
final results. The simulation runs in time proportional to the square of the number of particles.
Finally, viscosity and magnetism are not considered.
